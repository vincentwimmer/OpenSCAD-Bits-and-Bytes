### Driving Force GT - Universal Wheel Hub
> Universal Wheel Hub: Built to withstand the Wheel Base falling from most heights. Designed and unfortunately tested a few times with no issue after a popular design on Thingiverse failed me on the first fall.

> Materials required:
> - Wooden Dowel 7/8" Diameter - IIRC! (I also cut the dowel to be around 14" in length for a longer pull. However, for more resistance I would go shorter.)
> - Standard 7/8" Bicycle Handle Bar Grips (You'll obviously only use one. Get creative with the style.)
> - Standard 20k Potentiometer
> - #4 x 3/8" Screws
> - (Optional) Mini Round Rocker Switch (You can wire this to the signal and + of the potentiometer to create a "Parking Lock" switch.)
> - (Optional) 12"x2" of Permanent Vinyl Wrap (I used a Carbon Fib-ber one to wrap the wooden dowel.)

Assembly and wiring is pretty straight forward. Once setup with your Arduino board and operational, you'll need a tool like DIView to calibrate.

### Pedal Assembly - W.I.P.
